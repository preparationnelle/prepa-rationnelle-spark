                    The past few years have seen a surge of activism and social movements fighting for civil rights â€“ and in some cases, pushing back against them. In mid-2020, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement erupted into what was likely the largest protest wave in U.S. history. An estimated 15 to 26 million Americans participated in racial justice demonstrations after the murder of George Floyd, with rallies spanning all 50 states and even abroad. This unprecedented mobilization forced a national reckoning on police brutality and systemic racism. It led to policy responses in some cities (such as bans on chokeholds, or removing Confederate monuments) and greater corporate and institutional focus on diversity.

                  <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed">
                    In the UK too, BLM protests drew tens of thousands; in one iconic incident, demonstrators in Bristol toppled the statue of slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour. (Those protesters were later acquitted of vandalism, as jurors seemed to agree the statue's presence was offensive and outdated.) The Colston episode sparked a national conversation about how Britain commemorates its colonial past. We've since seen universities and museums re-evaluate symbols of imperialism, and some artefacts â€“ like the Benin Bronzes â€“ returned to their places of origin. Though the initial BLM momentum has slowed, it has left a lasting imprint: terms like "systemic racism" entered mainstream discourse, and communities of color continue to demand police reform and equal treatment.

                    Other social movements have also transformed the landscape. The #MeToo movement, which surged a few years earlier, continues to influence culture by holding powerful men accountable for sexual misconduct and pushing workplaces to enforce zero-tolerance policies. High-profile convictions (Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, etc.) and a general increase in awareness around consent and harassment can be traced to #MeToo's impact. Women's rights more broadly saw both advancements and setbacks. In a landmark regression, the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the federal constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years.

                  <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed">
                    This galvanized massive protests nationwide â€“ crowds poured into the streets of cities from New York to Los Angeles after the ruling, and many states immediately enacted abortion bans. President Biden and others decried the decision as a huge blow to women's freedom. In the year since, the fight has shifted to the state level: some states have protected abortion access or even enshrined it in law, while others have banned almost all abortions. The Roe reversal also prompted a rare bipartisan action in Congress: fearing that other rights (like same-sex marriage) might be in jeopardy, legislators passed the Respect for Marriage Act (RFMA) in late 2022. This law requires federal and interstate recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages, essentially codifying protections that had relied on Supreme Court precedents. The RFMA's passage â€“ signed by President Biden â€“ was a notable victory for LGBTQ+ rights at a time when other civil rights felt under threat.

                    Indeed, LGBTQ+ rights have themselves become a flashpoint. On one hand, acceptance of LGBTQ people is higher than ever in much of the Western world, and policies like RFMA show institutional support. Pride marches are massive annual events in many cities. Yet there has also been a pronounced backlash, particularly targeting transgender individuals. In the US, numerous states (especially conservative-led ones) have passed laws restricting transgender youth from accessing gender-affirming healthcare or participating in sports, and even laws limiting discussion of gender and sexuality in schools (like Florida's so-called "Don't Say Gay" law).
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed">
                    Trans rights activists and major medical organizations oppose these measures as harmful and discriminatory, and protests have occurred in state capitols. This "culture war" over trans rights mirrors a larger pattern: progressive social movements push for inclusion and the expansion of rights, while an opposing movement mobilizes fears and seeks to claw back some of those gains. Similar dynamics are visible in the UK â€“ for example, heated debates over reforming gender recognition laws led to political standoffs between the Scottish and UK governments in 2023. The tension between advancing LGBTQ+ rights and resisting conservative pushback has created a polarized environment where both sides see their fundamental values at stake.

                    Climate activism is another key social movement of our era. Groups like Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil in the UK, or the youth-led Sunrise Movement and climate strikers internationally, have used civil disobedience to demand urgent action on climate change. Their disruptive tactics (blocking roads, interrupting cultural events) have been polarizing â€“ drawing attention to the climate crisis, but also prompting stricter policing laws. In the UK, as mentioned, new protest laws were introduced partly in response to climate protesters' tactics, raising concerns about curbing civil liberties.

                  <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed">
                    Still, climate activists have succeeded in keeping environmental issues in the public eye, especially as real-world extreme weather (heatwaves, wildfires, floods) validates their alarm. The urgency of their message has been reinforced by scientific consensus and increasingly visible climate impacts. While some criticize their methods as too disruptive, others argue that the scale of the climate crisis justifies more aggressive forms of protest. The effectiveness of climate activism lies not just in immediate policy changes, but in shifting public consciousness and making environmental issues impossible to ignore. This has created a complex dynamic where environmental concerns compete with economic interests and public order considerations in policy debates.

                    All these movements â€“ for racial justice, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, climate action â€“ reflect a reinvigoration of civil society. They often encounter counter-movements (nationalist, nativist or religiously conservative currents) that portray themselves as defending traditional values. The result is a highly charged atmosphere where competing visions of society clash. These counter-movements often frame progressive social changes as threats to cultural identity, religious values, or national cohesion, creating a polarized environment where compromise becomes difficult.

                  <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed">
                    But it's worth noting that public opinion has in many ways shifted towards inclusion: for example, support for same-sex marriage in the US is at an all-time high (~70%), and a majority of Americans also said they support the BLM goals even if they might disagree on tactics. Likewise in Britain, attitudes on race and empire are slowly changing â€“ e.g. more people now acknowledge the negative aspects of colonialism and support teaching that history. Social movements have managed to broaden the conversation, even if the policy outcomes are mixed. The coming years will show whether these civil rights advances can be sustained and expanded, or whether pushback (legal and political) will stall their progress. The tension between advancing rights and maintaining social cohesion remains a central challenge for democratic societies.
