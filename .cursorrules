# Project Rules & SEO Guidelines

You are working on a high-performance web application. Always adhere to these rules:

## GEO & SEO Optimization (CRITICAL)

### Quick Wins (Apply constantly)
- **Metadata**: Ensure every page has a `SEOHead` component with `title` and `description`.
- **Headings**: Use hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3). H1 is for the main title only.
- **Images**: All `<img>` tags must have descriptive `alt` text.
- **URLs**: Keep URLs readable and descriptive (e.g., `/articles/culture-wars` not `/p=123`).
- **Performance**: Use lazy loading for images and avoid heavy blocking scripts.

### Long Term Strategy
- **Answer-First**: Start articles with a direct answer/definition for AI parsing.
- **FAQ**: Include a structured FAQ section (using `<Accordion>`) in every informational page.
- **Schema**: Always implement JSON-LD schema (Article, FAQPage, Course) via `SEOHead`.

## Code Style
- Use **React + TypeScript**.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Use **shadcn/ui** components for UI elements.
- Prefer functional components and hooks.
